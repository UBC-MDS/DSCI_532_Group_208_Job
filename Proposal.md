## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose  
In today's fast-changing world, the skills required from people are changing faster. It is difficult for a person to get an understanding of which professions have stood the test of time and which have not. As the world transforms with each new technological breakthrough, the society’s need for talents and abilities undergo a transformation too. The central purpose of the dashboard that we intend to build is to be a quick guiding tool to any person who wants to know which are the professions that are still standing relevant, which are the ones that have gained in popularity and, which are the ones that have fallen by the wayside. This tool can be used by sociologists for their research, by government planners and educationists to make decisions about the society’s education. It can also be used by the high school or college graduate to acquire an insight into what skills he or she needs to acquire to be gainfully employed in a stable occupation. The data set allows us to go back in time for more than 150 years. It would be very interesting to see which of these jobs have maintained a sustained requirement for such a long period.  
  
## Section 2: Description of the data  
The 'job' data set is from Vega Datasets, and 'job' data set contains information about jobs from 1850 to 2000. The data appears to be a subset of a census as the data points are available only every ten years which is when usually a census is taken in a country. The information includes occupations, gender, total counts and percentage of total workforce for each job. Our purpose of this data set is about looking for interesting patterns or features. We want to see the popularity of different jobs and calculated standard deviation of percentage. The problem of this data set is that we don't know who collected this data and how it was collected. Moreover, for occupations like professor, it is too detailed to do analysis, because professors for different subjects are recorded separately. We speculate that the 'perc' column means the percentage of that job of total employee group. Other column names are clear enough to understand. 
The standard deviation of the job group is used to arrive at the stability the job possesses.

 the description of the dataset related to variables contained in the dataset is not explicit enough, you also don't comment on the variable you are using for job stability and you include information that should be in the motivation/purpose section instead. Research questions are good, however as mentioned before, this app provides general insights but cannot be the only resource to make a "critical career decision" as described in the scenarios
  
## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios  

Below are 2 examples of the common usage scenarios that we envisage for our dashboard.  
  
- John is a high school graduate who is standing at a juncture in life and needs assistance so that he can make the correct career decisions that can have a significant impact on his future. He is interested in knowing what are the occupations that have been consistently in demand and which are the ones that have been gaining in popularity.  This information will help him gain an insight into how stable some skills have been over a period of time and which are the skills that are gaining popularity as time progressed.
  
- Jane is a policymaker with the Canadian ministry of education, and she has been mandated with the task of deciding on which kind of vocational courses should be made available to the public in the new technical school that the government is opening.  


  
### <span style="color:seagreen">Which are the most stable jobs?</span>
We intend to focus on the top 10 most stable professions and show how demands for these professions have remained constant over a long period of time.
  
### <span style="color:seagreen">Which are the top 10 popular professions in 2000?</span>
Using our dashboard we intend to provide the user with convincing answers to these research questions through data and its visualization.
