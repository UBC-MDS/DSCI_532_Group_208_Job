# Reflections:
The dash offers to the user a clear visualization that helps answer the research question. The plots are properly labeled and there is an appropriate use of color to highlight the different line plots which enable the user to visualize the selected data and differentiate one job role from the other.
The plots in the app follow the principle of proportional ink. The plot is minimalistic but still has the required interactive tools available such as drop-down menus and radio buttons. The plot gives the user the ability to select the data using mouse clicks so the user can further visualize the selected data in detail.  

## Improvements:  
The plots have data till the year 2000 which might make it seem outdated for a user who wants to use it in 2019.
This is because the source dataset itself is until the year 2000.
The data set has several more job roles, but we are focusing only on the top 10 of them. We would have liked to broaden the search and encompassed more job roles. The dataset has data that includes gender and that could have been used to widen the research question into including the distribution of job roles according to gender.
The plot itself could have been a bit more refined by adding a hamburger menu like that in the sketch. The controls for interactivity to be with shift-click and control-click instead of the current choosing of a window of selection and then moving it to highlight a specific area. The drop-down menu is a little disproportionate for the text that is inside it and that hides the down arrow of the menu. The legend font size could have been a bit bigger.  

## Feedback:
Specific feedback from the TAâ€™s to interpolate the missing values and to cite the data source has been incorporated into the app
